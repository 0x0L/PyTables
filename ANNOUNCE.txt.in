 Announcing PyTables @VERSION@
===========================

PyTables Pro is a library for managing hierarchical datasets and
designed to efficiently cope with extremely large amounts of data with
support for full 64-bit file addressing.  PyTables Pro runs on top of
the HDF5 library and NumPy package for achieving maximum throughput and
convenient use.  The main difference between PyTables Pro and regular
PyTables is that the Pro version includes OPSI, a new indexing
technology, allowing to perform data lookups in tables exceeding 10
gigarows (10**10 rows) in less than 1 tenth of a second.

Acknowledgments
===============

Thanks to many users who provided feature improvements, patches, bug
reports, support and suggestions.  See the ``THANKS`` file in the
distribution package for a (incomplete) list of contributors.  Most
specially, a lot of kudos go to the HDF5 and NumPy (and numarray!)
makers.  Without them PyTables simply would not exist.
