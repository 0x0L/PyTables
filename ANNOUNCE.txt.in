 Announcing PyTables @VERSION@
===========================

PyTables Pro is a library for managing hierarchical datasets and
designed to efficiently cope with extremely large amounts of data with
support for full 64-bit file addressing.  PyTables Pro runs on top of
the HDF5 library and NumPy package for achieving maximum throughput and
convenient use.  The main difference between PyTables Pro and regular
PyTables is that the Pro version includes OPSI, a new indexing
technology, allowing to perform data lookups in tables exceeding 10
gigarows (10**10 rows) in less than 1 tenth of a second.

In PyTables 2.1 many new features and a handful of bugs have been
addressed.  This is a release candidate, so, in addition to the tarball,
binaries for Windows are provided too.  Also, the API has been frozen
and you should only expect bug fixes and documentation improvements for
2.1 final (due to release in a couple of weeks now).

This version introduces important improvements, like much faster node
opening, creation or navigation, a file-based way to fine-tune the
different PyTables parameters (fully documented now in a new appendix of
the UG) and support for multidimensional atoms in EArray/CArray objects.

Regarding the Pro edition, four different kind of indexes are supported
so that the user can choose the best for her needs.  Also, and due to
the introduction of the concept of chunkmaps in OPSI, the responsiveness
of complex queries with low selectivity has improved quite a lot.  And
last but not least, it is possible now to sort tables by a specific
field with no practical limit in size (tables up to 2**48 rows).

In case you want to know more in detail what has changed in this
version, have a look at ``RELEASE_NOTES.txt`` in the tarball.  Find the

Acknowledgments
===============

Thanks to many users who provided feature improvements, patches, bug
reports, support and suggestions.  See the ``THANKS`` file in the
distribution package for a (incomplete) list of contributors.  Many
thanks also to SourceForge who have helped to make and distribute this
package!  And last, but not least thanks a lot to the HDF5 and NumPy
(and numarray!) makers. Without them PyTables simply would not exist.
