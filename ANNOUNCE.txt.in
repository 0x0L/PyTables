 Announcing PyTables @VERSION@
===========================

PyTables Pro is a library for managing hierarchical datasets and
designed to efficiently cope with extremely large amounts of data with
support for full 64-bit file addressing.  PyTables Pro runs on top of
the HDF5 library and NumPy package for achieving maximum throughput and
convenient use.  The main difference between PyTables Pro and regular
PyTables is that the Pro version includes OPSI, a new indexing
technology, allowing to perform data lookups in tables exceeding 10
gigarows (10**10 rows) in less than 1 tenth of a second.

This is the second (and probably last) release candidate for PyTables
2.2, so please test it as much as you can before I declare the beast
stable.  The main new features in 2.2 series are:

  * A new compressor called Blosc, designed to read/write data to/from
    memory at speeds that can be faster than a system `memcpy()` call.
    With it, many internal PyTables operations that are currently
    bounded by CPU or I/O bandwith are speed-up.  Some benchmarks:
    http://blosc.pytables.org/trac/wiki/SyntheticBenchmarks

  * A new `tables.Expr` module (based on Numexpr) that allows to do
    persistent, on-disk computations on many algebraic operations.
    For a brief look on its performance, see:
    http://pytables.org/moin/ComputingKernel

  * Support for HDF5 hard links, soft links and automatic external links
    (kind of mounting external filesystems).  A new tutorial about its
    usage has been added to the 'Tutorials' chapter of User's Manual.

  * Suport for 'fancy' indexing (i.e., Ã  la NumPy) in all the data
    containers in PyTables.  Backported from the implementation in the
    h5py project.  Thanks to Andrew Collette for its nice work on this!

As always, a large amount of bugs have been addressed and squashed too.

Acknowledgments
===============

Thanks to many users who provided feature improvements, patches, bug
reports, support and suggestions.  See the ``THANKS`` file in the
distribution package for a (incomplete) list of contributors.  Most
specially, a lot of kudos go to the HDF5 and NumPy (and numarray!)
makers.  Without them, PyTables simply would not exist.
