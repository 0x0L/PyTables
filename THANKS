March 2003

I would like to thank the people have contributed directly or
indirectly to PyTables. 

Scott Prater has revised some important documentation in order to make
them readable in english and besides, has conducted the tests of
PyTables on Solaris.

Vicent Mas for conducting some benchmarks on PyTables, comparing it with
cPickle performance on arrays.

Henner Eisen and Berthold Höllmann from Germanischer Lloyd, for
suggesting me to implement new capabilities, report on bugs, and
supporting the PyTables project with contracts.

Todd Miller and Perry Greenfield for promptly helping me to understand
many of the intricacies of the numarray package.

The HDF5 team at NCSA for doing such an excellent library for data
persistence.
