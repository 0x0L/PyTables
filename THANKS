December 2003

I would like to thank the people have contributed directly or
indirectly to PyTables. 

Scott Prater for editing the user's manual in order to make it more
readable in english, as well as conducting the tests of PyTables on
Solaris.

Torsten Bronger for writing tbook, an excellent XML authoring system,
which is used to create the different versions of the User's Manual
(both the PDF and HTML versions). He promptly answered my questions
and he was always very helpful.

Henner Eisen and Berthold Höllmann from Germanischer Lloyd, for
suggesting me to implement new capabilities, report on bugs, and
supporting the PyTables project with contracts.

Todd Miller and Perry Greenfield for promptly helping me to understand
many of the intricacies of the numarray package and Jin-chung Hsu for
discussions on recarray module (now numarray.records module). They
have been very receptive and promptly worked-out most of the
improvements in numarray (specially in the records module) that were
necessary for PyTables.

Alan McIntyre for porting PyTables to Windows.

John Nielsen for suggesting improvements and delivering code for
completely avoid the recursion algorithms and allowing pytables to
bypass the ~1000 levels of deepness that Python recursion limit
imposed.

The HDF5 team at NCSA for making such an excellent library for data
persistence, and specially Pedro Vicente and Quincey Koziol, for
quickly including my suggested patches to the HDF5_HL and solving the
reported bugs in HDF5 library.
