July 2003

I would like to thank the people have contributed directly or
indirectly to PyTables. 

Scott Prater has revised some important documentation in order to make
them readable in english and besides, has conducted the tests of
PyTables on Solaris.

Torsten Bronger for writing tbook, an excellent XML authoring system,
which is used to create the different versions of the User's Manual
(both the PDF and HTML versions). He promptly answered my questions
and he was always very helpful.

Henner Eisen and Berthold Höllmann from Germanischer Lloyd, for
suggesting me to implement new capabilities, report on bugs, and
supporting the PyTables project with contracts.

Todd Miller and Perry Greenfield for promptly helping me to understand
many of the intricacies of the numarray package. And also to Jin-chung
Hsu for discussions on recarray module (now numarray.records module).

Alan McIntyre for porting PyTables to Windows.

John Nielsen for suggesting improvements and delivering code for
completely avoid the recursion algorithms and allowing pytables to
bypass the ~1000 levels of deepness that Python recursion limit
imposed.

The HDF5 team at NCSA for making such an excellent library for data
persistence.
