TODO list (as of 7th, May 2003):

- Add unlimited dimension arrays, a la ScientificPython.IO.NetCDF module.

- Implement relations (like and object oriented database) between objects.

- Add general attributes to tree node objects. Try to support general
  Python objects as attributes (this is partially solved by the
  addition of setAttrNode/getAttrNode methods and the use of cPickle).

- Improve the performance (although no much room remains for doing
  that).

And as always...

- Add more tests

- Add examples

- Better documentation
