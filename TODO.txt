TODO list (as of 4th, October 2002):

- Add Numeric or NumArray objects support. I would prefer to add
  support the second, but the API is stable enough?, well documented?
  Somebody can give me some feedback?

- Check the RecordArray objects present on NumArray. Can this made the
  conversion (Python types <-> C types) process more efficient?

- API stability. Is good more than one way to do things? Reach a
  consistent API by the beta version. Feedback appreciated.

- Add more tests.

- Add examples.

- Better documentation.
