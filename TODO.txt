TODO list (as of 11th, November 2002):

- Add unlimited dimension arrays, a la ScientificPython.IO.NetCDF module.

- Add general attributes to tree node objects. Try to support general
  Python objects as attributes.

- Add the latest HDF5_HL libraries (no beta).

- Check the RecordArray objects present on NumArray. Can this made the
  conversion (Python types <-> C types) process more efficient?

- API stability. Is good more than one way to do things? Reach a
  consistent API by the beta version. Feedback appreciated.


And as always...

- Add more tests

- Add examples

- Better documentation
