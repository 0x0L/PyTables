TODO list (as of 25th, January 2005):

- Add the capability to search in multiple (eventually indexed) columns.

- Add a new class (say RowMod) that would be returned by
  Table.iterrows() and would allow to do things like this:

for row in mytable.iterrows():
    row['x'] = row['x'] + 0.5

- Add a new type of table that allows variable length records and
  fully multidimensional slice selections.

- Implement relations (like and object oriented database) between
  objects.

- Right now, each Table has its own buffer which can eat a lot of
  memory (between 5 KB and 60 KB per Table) if you have many
  Tables. It would be nice to implement lazy creation of the buffer,
  and a destruction when it is no longer needed.

- Improve the performance.

- Add tutorials about EArray and VLArray objects.

- Add tutorials about indexation.

And as always...

- Add more tests (there's always space for bugs in untested situations).
