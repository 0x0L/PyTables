TODO list (as of 10th, Jul 2004):

- Add a new type of table that allows variable length records and
  fully multidimensional slice selections.

- Implement relations (like and object oriented database) between
  objects.

- Implement indexation on tables.

- Right now, each Table has its own buffer which can take a lot of
  memory (between 5 KB and 60 KB per Table) if you have many
  Tables. It would be nice to implement lazy creation of the buffer,
  and a destruction when it is no longer needed.

- Improve the performance (although no much room remains for doing
  that).

- Add tutorials about EArray and VLArray objects

And as always...

- Add more tests (there's always space for bugs in untested situations)
