TODO list (as of 18th, January 2006):

- Add a tutorial for describing the extended slice support in deep.

- Add a new class (say RowMod) that would be returned by
  Table.iterrows() and would allow to do things like this:

for row in mytable.iterrows():
    row['x'] = row['x'] + 0.5

- Add the possibility to named axes in *Array objects, so that the
  next can be made:

pressure = [[1, 1.25 , 1.78 , 1.4],
            [3.1 , 2.4 , 1.89 , 8.2],
            [4.5 , 7.9 , 4.63 , 1],
            [1.2 , 3.7 , 4.26 , 6]]
pressure.axis.longitude=[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]
pressure.axir.latitude=[0.25, 0.35, 0.45, 0.55]

so the next question:

pressure.where(pressure.axis.longitude == 0.2 and
               pressure.axis.latitude == 0.45 )

should give: 7.9 as answer.

- Add a new type of table that allows variable length records and
  fully multidimensional slice selections.

- Implement relations (like and object oriented database) between
  objects.

- Right now, each Table has its own buffer which can eat a lot of
  memory (between 5 KB and 60 KB per Table) if you have many
  Tables. It would be nice to implement lazy creation of the buffer,
  and a destruction when it is no longer needed.

- Improve the performance.

- Add tutorials about EArray and VLArray objects.

- Add tutorials about indexation.

And as always...

- Add more tests (there's always space for bugs in untested situations).
