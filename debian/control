Description: A hierarchical database for Python based on HDF5
 PyTables is a hierarchical database package designed to efficently
 manage very large amounts of data. PyTables is built on top of the
 HDF5 library and the numarray package. It features an object-oriented
 interface that, combined with natural naming and C-code generated
 from Pyrex sources, makes it a fast, yet extremely easy to use tool
 for interactively save and retrieve large amounts of data.
 .
 This differs from PyHL interface to HDF5 in that PyTables has a
 completely object-oriented interface, rather that the more
 function-oriented approach of PyHL. In addition, PyTables has these
 other distinctive features:
 .
  - Compound types (records) can be used entirely from Python (i.e. it
    is not necessary to use C for taking advantage of them).
  - The tables are both enlargeable and compressible.
  - I/O is buffered, so you can get very fast I/O, specially with
    tables.
  - Very easy to select data through the use of iterators over the
    rows in tables. Extended slicing is supported as well.
  - It supports both Numeric and numarray objects.
 .
 This Debian package is a mostly empty package that always depends on
 a package built for Debian's default Python version. Note, however,
 that the unit tests for pytables are here.
