Description: hierarchical database for Python based on HDF5
 PyTables is a hierarchical database package designed to efficently
 manage very large amounts of data. PyTables is built on top of the
 HDF5 library and the NumPy package. It features an object-oriented
 interface that, combined with natural naming and C-code generated
 from Pyrex sources, makes it a fast, yet extremely easy to use tool
 for interactively save and retrieve large amounts of data.
 .
  - Compound types (records) can be used entirely from Python (i.e. it
    is not necessary to use C for taking advantage of them).
  - The tables are both enlargeable and compressible.
  - I/O is buffered, so you can get very fast I/O, specially with
    large tables.
  - Very easy to select data through the use of iterators over the
    rows in tables. Extended slicing is supported as well.
  - It supports the complete set of NumPy, Numeric and numarray objects.
