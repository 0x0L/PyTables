Things to have in mind when migrating from PyTables 1.x to PyTables
2.x series:

- Leaf.stype --> Leaf.type
- Leaf.type --> Leaf.dtype
- "CharType" --> "string"
- "Complex32", "Complex64" --> "complex64", "complex128"
- PyTables types (previously called "string types") are now written in
  lower case, so "Type" becomes "type".  See the appendix on supported
  data types in the manual for more information on PyTables types.
- "non-relevant" --> "irrelevant" (applied to byteorders)
- Table.colstypes --> Table.coltypes
- Table.coltypes --> Table.coldtypes
- Table.colshapes & Table.colitemsizes have disappeared
- Description.itemsize have disappeared
- In-kernel conditions must be written as strings.
- You can no longer mark a column for indexing through a ``Col``
  constructor.  The only way of creating an index for a column is to
  invoke the ``createIndex()`` method of the proper column object
  under ``Table.cols`` *after the table has been created*.
- New meanings of atom shape and array shape.
- New argument ``chunkshape`` of chunked arrays.
- ``Atom`` and ``Col`` are now abstract classes, so you can't use them
  to create atoms or column definitions of an arbitrary type.  If you
  know the particular type you need, use the proper subclass;
  otherwise, use the ``Atom.from_*()`` or ``Col.from_*()`` factory
  methods.  See the section on declarative classes in the reference.

  You are also advised to avoid using the inheritance of atoms to
  check for their kind or type; for that purpose, use their ``kind``
  and ``type`` attributes.
- The ``dtype`` argument of ``EnumAtom`` and ``EnumCol`` constructors
  has been replaced by the ``base`` argument, which can take a
  full-blown atom, although it accepts bare PyTables types as well.
  This is a *mandatory* argument now.
- Flavors can *only* be set through the ``flavor`` attribute of
  leaves, and they are *persistent*, so changing a flavor requires
  that the file be writable.

  Flavors can no longer be set through ``File.create*()`` methods, the
  ``flavor`` argument previously found in some ``Table`` methods, nor
  through ``Atom`` constructors or the ``_v_flavor`` attribute of
  descriptions.
