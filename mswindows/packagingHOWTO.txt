Commercial package for Windows
------------------------------

::

In order to set the MingW compiler environment you have to add MingW
paths to the PATH, LIB and INCLUDE variables. You can do it with a batch
script.

*** Important: read this COMPLETELY before proceed! ****
The installer gets some files from PyTablesPro sources in your working
copy of the repository but obtains the extensions from the local
PyTablesPro installation [1]_ so keep them synchronized.

It expects both PyTablesPro and numpy to be installed in their default
directory with their folders renamed to tables_orig and numpy_orig.
This way, if PyTablesPro is completely uninstalled later (using its
uninstaller), it can be built again without reinstalling the
tables/numpy package(s).

Finally, check that the NUMPYVERSION in mswindows\Makefile_windows does
correspond to your installed version in numpy_orig.  You have to do this
manually!

******************

  set a MingW compiler environment for your DOS shell
  cd path_to_PytablesPro_working_copy\mswindows
  mingw32-make -f Makefile_windows PYTHONVERSION=xx clean
  mingw32-make -f Makefile_windows PYTHONVERSION=xx LICENSE=yy installer

Currently xx can be 24 (for Python 2.4) or 25 (for Python 2.5).
The kind of license to be included in the binary package is
yy=development, site, personal.

You can repeat the last step (i.e. make installer) for every combination
of xx and yy, i.e. it is not necessary a make clean every time.


Package testing
---------------

Once a installer package has been made you must test it i.e. you must
check that it INSTALLS properly the software. To do it is easy, just run
the installer and check that:

* data files are installed in the installation directory
* python modules and extensions are installed in the right directory
* shortcuts are created in the applications menu

Beware that every item of the list is set by you during the installation
process.

Further testing
---------------

Before a package is made publicaly available you must check, at least
minimally, that the packaged software works properly. That's easy too,
just install the package, go to a non-pytables source directory and
issue this command:

python -c "import tables; tables.test()"

Pay attention not only that every test passes ok, but also that the
versions of sofwtare printed out are correct (spec. PyTables)!

It is strongly recommended to do this if you are making several
PyTablesPro packages. This way, if testing a given package fails, you
can fix the problem and make sure that it will not affect to the
remaining packages.
