============================

Feature coming from (now liberated) PyTables Pro
------------------------------------------------

- New OPSI engine (indexing)

- Enhanced caching

.. todo:: enhance this section

Other changes
-------------

- Indexes with no elements are now evaluated as non-CSI ones.  Closes
  #312.

- Numexpr presence is tested now in setup.py, provided that user is not
  using setuptools (i.e. ``easy_install`` or ``pip`` tools).  When using
  setuptools, numexpr continues to be a requisite (and Cython too).
  Closes #298.

- Cython is enforced now during compilation time.  Also, it is not
  required when running tests.

- Repeatedly closing a file that has been reopened several times is
  supported now.  Closes #318.

- The number of times a file has been currently reopened is available
  now in the new `File.open_count` read-only attribute.

- The entire documentation set has been converted to sphinx (close
  :issue:`85` and :issue:`86`) that now also has an index
  (closes :issue`39`).

- The entire test suite has been updated to use unittest specific
  assertions (closes :issue:`66`).

- PyTables has been tested against latest version of numpy (v. 1.6.1
  and 2.0dev) and Cython (v, 0.15) packages. Closes :issue:`84`.

- The setup.py script has been improved to better detect runtimes
  (closes :issue:`73`).

Deprecations
------------

Support for some old packages and related features has been deprecated
and will be removed in future versions:

- Numeric (closes :issue:`76`)
- numarray (closes :issue`76` and :issue:`75`)
- HDF5 1.6.x (closes :issue`96`)

At the API level the following are now deprecated:

- the tables.is_pro constant is deprecated because PyTables Pro
  has been released under an open source license.
- the netcdf3 sub-package (closes :issue:`67`)
- the nra sub-package
