Changes from 2.2.1 to 2.3b1
===========================

- Indexes with no elements are now evaluated as non-CSI ones.  Closes
  #312.

- Numexpr presence is tested now in setup.py, provided that user is not
  using setuptools (i.e. ``easy_install`` or ``pip`` tools).  When using
  setuptools, numexpr continues to be a requisite (and Cython too).
  Closes #298.

- Cython is enforced now during compilation time.  Also, it is not
  required when running tests.

- Repeatedly closing a file that has been reopened several times is
  supported now.  Closes #318.

- The number of times a file has been currently reopened is available
  now in the new `File.open_count` read-only attribute.


Changes from 2.2 to 2.2.1
=========================

- When using `ObjectAtom` objects in `VLArrays` the ``HIGHEST_PROTOCOL``
  is used for pickling objects.  For NumPy arrays, this simple change
  leads to space savings up to 3x and time improvements up to 30x.
  Closes #301.

- The `Row` accessor implements a new `__contains__` special method that
  allows doing things like::

    for row in table:
        if item in row:
            print "Value found in row", row.nrow
            break

  Closes #309.

- tables.Expr can perform operations on scalars now.  Thanks to GaÃ«tan
  de Menten for providing a patch for this.  Closes #287.

- Fixed a problem with indexes larger than 32-bit on leaf objects on
  32-bit machines.  Fixes #283.

- ``leaf[numpy.array[scalar]]`` idiom returns a NumPy array instead of
  an scalar.  This has been done for compatibility with NumPy.  Closes
  #303.

- Optimization for `Table.copy()` so that ``FIELD_*`` attrs are not
  overwritten during the copy.  This can lead to speed-ups up to 100x
  for short tables that have hundreds of columns.  Closes #304.

- For external links, its relative paths are resolved now with respect
  to the directory of the main HDF5 file, rather than with respect to
  the current directory.  Closes #306.

- ``Expr.setInputsRange()`` and ``Expr.setOutputRange()`` do support
  ``numpy.integer`` types now.  Closes #285.

- Column names in tables can start with '__' now.  Closes #291.

- Unicode empty strings are supported now as atributes.  Addresses #307.

- Cython 0.13 and higher is supported now.  Fixes #293.
