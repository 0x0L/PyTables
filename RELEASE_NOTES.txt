Changes from 2.0.x to 2.1b2
===========================

- When opening a node, that will be done directly, without populating first
  all the parent directories.  So, for opening pre-known group and leaf
  locations, the new code is substantially faster (in fact, the cost is O(1)).


API changes from 2.0.x to 2.1b2
===============================

- New File.fileno() added.  This returns the underlying OS file descriptor for
  the file.

- The Table.indexFilters property has been removed (after a period of
  ``DeprecationWarnings``).  If you want to change filters in indexes, please
  use the `filters` parameter of the Column.createIndex() method (and the
  like).

- Table.willQueryUseIndexing() has changed its return value by a frozen set of
  usable indexed columns for its `condition` parameter.

- The `sort` parameter of Table.itersequence() has been removed as it will not
  allow to sort sequences larger than memory.  In addition, it is not clear
  that sorting would be a clear advantage in all situations.
