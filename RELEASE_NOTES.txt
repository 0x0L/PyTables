Changes from 3.0 to 3.1.0 (in development)
==========================================

New features
------------

- Now PyTables is able to save/restore the default value of :class:`EnumAtom`
  types (closes :issue:`234`).
- Implemented support for the H5FD_SPLIT driver (closes :issue:`288`,
  :issue:`289` and :issue:`295`). Many thanks to simleo.
- New quantization filter: the filter truncates floating point data to a
  specified precision before writing to disk. This can significantly improve
  the performance of compressors (closes :issue:`261`).
  Thanks to Andreas Hilboll.
- Added new :meth:`VLArray.get_row_size` method to :class:`VLArray` for
  querying the number of atoms of a :class:`VLArray` row.
  Closes :issue:`24` and :issue:`315`.


Improvements
------------

- Documented an unexpected behaviour with string literals in query conditions
  on Python 3 (closes :issue:`265`)
- The deprecated :mod:`getopt` module has been dropped in favour of
  :mod:`argparse` in all command line utilities (close :issue:`251`)
- Improved the installation section of the :doc:`../usersguide/index`.

  * instructions for installing PyTables via pip_ have been added.
  * added a reference to the Anaconda_, Canopy_ and `Christoph Gohlke suites`_
    (closes :issue:`291`)

- Enabled `Travis-CI`_ builds for Python_ 3.3
- :meth:`Tables.read_coordinates` now also works with boolean indices input.
  Closes :issue:`287` and :issue:`298`.
- Automatically disable extended float support if a buggy version of HDF5
  is detected (see also `Issues with H5T_NATIVE_LDOUBLE`_).
  See also :issue:`275`, :issue:`290` and :issue:`300`.
- Improved compatibility with numpy_ >= 1.8 (see :issue:`259`)
- The code of the benchmark programs (bench directory) has been updated.
  Closes :issue:`114`.
- The internal Blosc_ library has been updated to version 1.3.2
- The node caching mechanism has been completely redesigned to be simpler and
  less dependent from specific behaviours of the ``__del__`` method.
  Now PyTables is compatible with the forthcoming Python 3.4.
  Closes :issue:`306`.
- PyTables no longer uses shared/cached file handlers. This change somewhat
  improves support for concurrent reading allowing the user to safely open the
  same file in different threads for reading.
  See also :issue:`130`, :issue:`129` :issue:`292` and :issue:`216`.


Bugs fixed
----------

- Fixed detection of platforms supporting Blosc_
- Fixed a crash that occurred when one attempts to write a numpy_ array to
  an :class:`Atom` (closes :issue:`209` and :issue:`296`)
- Prevent creation of a table with no columns (closes :issue:`18` and
  :issue:`299`)
- Fixed a memory leak that occurs when iterating over
  :class:`CArray`/:class:`EArray` objects (closes :issue:`308`,
  see also :issue:`309`).
  Many thanks to Alistair Muldal.
- Make NaN types sort to the end. Closes :issue:`282` and :issue:`313`
- Fix computation of the buffer size for iterations on rows.
  The buffes size was overestimated resulting in a :exc:`MemoryError`
  in some cases.
  Closes :issue:`316`. Thamks to bbudescu.
- Better check of file open mode. Closes :issue:`318`.
- The Blosc filter now works correctly together with fletcher32.
  Closes :issue:`21`.


Deprecations
------------

Following the plan for the complete transition to the new (PEP8_ compliant)
API, all calls to the old API will raise a :exc:`DeprecationWarning`.

The new API has been introduced in PyTables 3.0 and is backward incompatible.
In order to guarantee a smoother transition the old API is still usable even
if it is now deprecated.

The plan for the complete transition to the new API is outlined in
:issue:`224`.
