This document details the modifications of PyTables Pro since PyTables
Standard version 1.x.  Its main purpose is help you ensure that your programs
will be runnable when you switch from PyTables Std 1.x to PyTables Pro @VERSION@.


API additions
=============

- Posar ac√≠ les coses relacionades amb els indexos

- The new ``Table.colinstances`` dictionary maps column pathnames to their
  associated ``Column`` or ``Cols`` object for simple or nested columns,
  respectively.  This is similar to ``Table.cols._f_col()``, but faster.

- ``File.createEArray()`` received a new ``shape`` parameter.  This allows to
  not have to use the shape of the atom so as to set the shape of the
  underlying dataset (this change was needed for a future use of the atom
  shape as the dimensionality of the atom type).

- ``File.createCArray()`` has received a new ``chunksize`` parameter. This
  allows to not have to use the shape of the atom so as to set the chunksize
  of the underlying dataset (this change was needed for a future use of the
  atom shape as the dimensionality of the atom type).

Backward-incompatible changes
=============================

- The dictionaries File.objects, File.leaves and File.groups has been removed.
  If you need this functionality, please, use the File.getNode() and
  File.walkNodes() instead. (XXX documentar!!!)

- ``Table.removeIndex()`` is no longer available; to remove an index on a
  column, one must use the ``removeIndex()`` method of the associated
  ``Column`` instance.

- ``complib`` and ``complevel`` parameters have been removed from
  ``File.createTable``, ``File.createEArray``, ``File.createCArray`` and
  ``File.createVLArray``. They were already deprecated in PyTables 1.x.

- Parameters ``shape`` and ``atom`` has been swapped in
  ``File.createCArray()``. This has been done to be consistent with Atom()
  definitions (i.e. type comes before and shape after).

Deprecated features
===================

- Node._f_isOpen() and Leaf.isOpen() methods has been removed. Please, use
  Node._v_isopen attribute instead (it is much faster). (XXX documentar!!!)


API refinements
===============

- ????


Bug fixes (affecting API)
=========================

- None
